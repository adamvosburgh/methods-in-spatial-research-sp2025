### Due: 3/28, with Mapping Portfolio

### What

**This is an extra credit assignment.** Completing this assignment will add one point to the rubric explained in 'Class Requirements and Grading' on the syllabus.

Complete either tutorial 8, 9, or 10+11 (as a pair) and complete the corresponding assignment:

### Tutorial 8: Making Data from Street View

Use the Google Street View Static API to download street view images for 20 - 100 significant locations of your choosing. Also pay attention to the camera bearing/orientation.

Design a layout to present the images on one or more pages (or GIFs)

Submission Materials:

A multi page PDF with: 
- Page 1: the layout you designed, and a link to your google colab notebook.
- Page 2: A screenshot of the directory on your computer where you have saved your downloaded images 

- A downloaded csv or geojson of your final dataset (on canvas)

### Tutorial 9: Making Data in Python:

Now that we have recreated a portion of Tutorial 1 in Python, for the assignment please wrangle your own data to create your own map. You can choose anything you like, but you must have at least one non-spatial dataset, and join it to a spatial one. If you are not sure of what you may choose, you could recreate tutorial 5 in your notebook (just the tutorial, not the challenge).

Submission Materials:

- A single page PDF with your map as a .png, and a link to your google colab notebook.
- A downloaded csv or geojson of your final dataset

### Tutorial 10+11:

Create your own story map, using one of the tutorials we have already made, or your own dataset.

Submission Materials:

A multi-page PDF with:
- Page 1: a representative screenshot of your story map, with a title, two sentence summary, and a link to the live map.
- Page 2: A representative screen recording of your story map (less than 30 seconds, does not have to be the full story).

### Submission

- Upload your work on Canvas (refer to specific instructions above) 
- Include it in your finalized Mapping Portfolio

### Optional additional exercise 

Do all three!
